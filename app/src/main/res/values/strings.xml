    <string name="text_activity_main">This is the home screen of the app (Please scroll down inside
        this TextView if some text is appearing to be cutoff. You can also scroll inside this layout).
        This Activity contain a list of CardViews for albums, artists, playlist and genre in vertical
        orientation. Each CardView will have a picture inside an ImageView corresponding to a particular
        album, artist, playlist or genre. The ImageViews which are holding these arts (like a particular
        album cover) will itself acts like a button because an OnClickListener is associated with them.
        So they will act as buttons as well. Here for explanation purpose I have taken 2 pictures each
        for album, artists, genre and playlist. When you click on it a second activity will be opened.
        You can click on any of the 8 images in this activity and can find it out.
    </string>

    <string name="text_activity_generic">This is the second activity (Please scroll down inside
        this TextView if some text is appearing to be cutoff.You can also scroll inside this layout).
        When you click on any of the images inside albums, artists, playlist or genre in 1st activity,
        then this 2nd activity will pop up. Depending upon under which category you had clicked in the
        1st activity, the title bar of this activity will be changed to ALBUM/album_name or
        ARTISTS/artist_name and so on. Below the title bar, an enlarged image will come which you had
        clicked earlier in 1st activity. Below that a list of songs will come corresponding to that
        artist,album,playlist or genre. (here for example purpose I have displayed only 1 dummy song
        for each album,artists,playlist and genre). To go to the third activity, click on the song
        name below</string>

    <string name="text_activity_current_song.xml">"This is the third activity (Please scroll down inside
        this TextView if some text is appearing to be cutoff. You can also scroll inside this layout).
        Description in title par put now playing. put a circular ball in viewbar. read all these texts
        of all the 3 activities. add some more. Modify statement order. place some . , ; etc.
        I have only implemented the pause/play button although project requirement doesn't ask to
        implement functionality. If you click on play/pause button then its image will change
        and it will be reflected in previous activity also.(i.e. in the bottom CardView in 1st and
        2nd Activity which displays the current song being played/paused)"</string>
